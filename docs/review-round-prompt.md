# Review round prompt

Copy this into a scratch file, fill in the placeholders, delete the lines that do not apply, and pass it to `scripts/review-dispatch.py --prompt` (add `--surface` when the section has `Surface: yes`). The prompt does not pick the lenses or the effort: the pin's `[schedule]` in `.conclave/reviewers.toml` does. The dispatcher counts the rounds already in the `--record` file, sets the reasoning effort and appends a `## Lenses for this pass` block naming this round's lenses, so the same prompt file serves every round. The lens list below is the fallback for a pin without a schedule.

You are an independent, adversarial code reviewer. Do not modify any file. Review the candidate below and report what is wrong with it, not what is right.

## Candidate

- Commit or range: `<FULL_SHA>` or `<BASE_SHA>..<TIP_SHA>` (inspect it with `git show` or `git diff`).
- What it is meant to do: `<one or two sentences>`.
- TODO section, when there is one: `<DNN TNN §N>` (its contract: `python3 scripts/todo-graph.py resolve "<DNN TNN §N>"`).
- Governing documents: `AGENTS.md` and `<the spec, plan or design file that applies>`.

## Lenses

Give a verdict per lens: `approve`, `needs-attention` (numbered findings, each with `file:line`, what fails and how to reproduce it) or `advisory`. Tag every finding with its severity: `P1` (wrong result, data loss, a check that passes what it must refuse, or a safety or security gap), `P2` (a real defect with a narrower trigger or a recoverable failure), `P3` (an edge case unlikely in practice, wording, or test coverage). An untagged finding counts as `P1`.

Proportionality: a `P1` or `P2` finding must be a failure that can happen in this repository's real operation: a document a user can open (Recto treats every PDF, Office and HTML file as hostile, so a crafted file that crashes, hangs, exhausts memory, leaks data or produces wrong output is real), a real user action, or a real operating-system, disk or hardware condition. A contrived scenario is `P3`: one that needs the attacker to already control the machine, the clock, the repository, the build or the tools, or a precondition no real file, user or system produces (tampering with the system clock, editing files mid-run, a hand-patched binary). Name the real path in the reproduction; a finding without one is `P3`.

Severity is what decides when the review loop ends, so tag by consequence, not by how sure you are (owner decision 2026-10-28). A `P1` names, in its reproduction, the real path and one of these consequences: a crash, memory corruption or undefined behaviour; data loss or a file written in place; a secret or private data exposed; a hang or memory use on the order of seconds or gigabytes from a small input; wrong output on a valid file; or a check that passes what it must refuse. A bounded transient cost (a copy, a short allocation, a slower path within its limits), a cosmetic result on a malformed file, or a defensive bound that already holds is `P2` or `P3`. A finding that repeats an item under "Settled items" below, without new evidence that its reason is wrong, is not a finding.

- `adversarial`: hostile or malformed input, bounds, races, cancellation and error paths, unsafe automation, secrets reaching logs or arguments.
- `consistency`: the repository's own module rules, naming, shared components, settings and error handling.
- `integration`: callers and consumers of what changed, contracts between components, anything that reads the changed data.
- `source-defect`: whether the governing spec or upstream documentation is read accurately, with deviations named.
- `design`: for user-facing surfaces, whether the rendered result matches the design source and every control works.
- `record`: whether the claimed test output and evidence match what actually ran, and nothing is marked done that is not.
- `plan-delivery`: whether the build delivered every checklist item and `Done when:` of the section, with nothing partial or stubbed.
- `quality`: whether the code is clear, minimal and maintainable, and every test exercises the behaviour it names.
- `optimization`: where the change wastes time, memory, I/O or redraws on the paths users hit.

## Reply format

One section per lens with its verdict and findings, then a line naming the highest severity among your findings, `HIGHEST: P1`, `HIGHEST: P2`, `HIGHEST: P3` or `HIGHEST: none`, then a final line: `OVERALL: approve` or `OVERALL: needs-attention`. If you could not read the candidate at all (the commit, the diff or the files), say why in one line and end with `OVERALL: blocked` instead: that is not a review, and the round records no review.
