# Completion and excellence review prompt

Copy this into a scratch file, fill in the placeholders, delete the lines that do not apply, and pass it to `scripts/review-dispatch.py --kind completion --candidate <FULL_SHA> --writer claude --prompt <file> --record docs/reviews/<NN-domain>/D<NN>-T<NN>-s<N>.md`. It runs once per section, after the section is built and before the regular review rounds (`docs/review-round-prompt.md`), and is not counted as a round.

---

You are an independent product reviewer. Do not modify any file. The candidate below is a feature a TODO section has just built. Answer two questions about it: is it complete for a user, and does it beat the strongest competitor at the same job. Report what is missing or weaker, not what is present and fine.

## Candidate

- Commit or range: `<FULL_SHA>` or `<BASE_SHA>..<TIP_SHA>` (inspect it with `git show` or `git diff`).
- TODO section: `<DNN TNN §N>` (its contract: `python3 scripts/todo-graph.py resolve "<DNN TNN §N>"`).
- The TODO file's Goal and Outcome (with its Adjacency line): `<path to the TODO file>`.
- Fidelity: `<the design/SPEC.md sections and the design/screenshots board the section names>`, or `none (Surface: no)`.
- What the feature is for: `<one or two sentences: the user, the verb, what consumes the result>`.
- Governing documents: `AGENTS.md` (its Product ambition section), `docs/acrobat-parity.md` and `<the plan or spec that applies>`.

## Part 1: completeness

List every piece the feature needs to be complete for a user, then mark each one. Think the feature through end to end, the way a user meets it: an Open file feature also needs its menu item, toolbar button, `Ctrl+O`, `Ctrl+K` command, recent-files entry, drag-and-drop, error dialog and tests. Cover every kind below that applies:

- Controls, menu items and toolbar entries, each with its automation name and tooltip.
- Keyboard shortcuts and the `Ctrl+K` command box entry for every command.
- Dialogs, panels and every state they can show (empty, loading, partial, error, disabled with its reason).
- Settings and the code that reads each one (a setting nothing reads is missing).
- Error and refusal paths: hostile or malformed input, cancellation, a full disk, a locked file, a missing permission.
- The undo or reverse path of every create, change or delete.
- Persistence and its read-back: what is saved, where, written temp-file-then-replace, and read back on the next start.
- Tests that would fail if the piece broke.

Mark each item `present` (name the `file:line` or test that shows it), `missing-in-scope` (the section's contract, its Fidelity surface or its Goal covers it, so the section must build it) or `missing-out-of-scope` (a real need the section's contract does not cover, so it is filed as a new section; say which domain owns it).

Proportionality: list only needs that arise in this repository's real operation: a document a user can open (every PDF, Office and HTML file is treated as hostile, so a crafted file a user receives is real), a real user action, or a real operating-system, disk or hardware condition. Do not list a need that only a contrived scenario creates (an attacker who already controls the machine, the clock, the repository, the build or the tools, or a precondition no real file, user or system produces).

## Part 2: excellence

Recto takes on Adobe Acrobat Pro, Foxit PDF Editor, Wondershare PDFelement and UPDF and must do each job better, not only reach parity. For this feature, name how the strongest competitor does the same job (Acrobat Pro first, then Foxit, PDFelement, UPDF; say which you are comparing with and what you know of its behaviour), then list each concrete way Recto's delivered feature falls short of beating it:

- Speed: time to first result, time on a large or damaged file, work done on the UI thread.
- Steps: clicks, keystrokes and dialogs for the common case, counted against the competitor's.
- Defaults: what the user gets without changing anything.
- Error recovery: what happens on a bad file, a cancel, a crash or a full disk, and whether work survives.
- Accessibility: keyboard paths, screen-reader names and order, contrast, scaling, reduced motion.
- Polish: wording, feedback while it runs, consistency with the rest of Recto.

Give each shortfall a measurable target where you can (a time, a step count, a golden image) and mark it `in-scope` (it fits the section's designed surface and behaviour, so the section builds it now) or `out-of-scope` (it needs a new section, or a `design/SPEC.md` subsection and board first because it changes the designed surface). Never propose weakening a Recto improvement that is already decided.

## Reply format

Part 1 as a numbered list of every item with its mark and evidence. Part 2 as the competitor named, then a numbered list of shortfalls, each with its target and mark. Then a numbered gap list that repeats every `missing-in-scope`, `missing-out-of-scope`, `in-scope` and `out-of-scope` item in one place, one line each, with its mark. Then a final line: `COMPLETION: complete` when the gap list is empty, or `COMPLETION: gaps` when it is not. If you could not read the candidate at all (the commit, the diff or the files), say why in one line and end with `COMPLETION: blocked` instead: that is not a review.
