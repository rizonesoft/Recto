"""Merge dependency pull requests (Dependabot and the pins workflow) when it is safe, one at a time.

    python scripts/merge_prs.py              # merge what is eligible now
    python scripts/merge_prs.py --dry-run    # say what would merge, change nothing
    python scripts/merge_prs.py --scheduled  # the recto-pr-merge task: stand aside while a campaign runs

Safe to run: the working tree is clean, HEAD is origin/main after a fetch (nothing waits to be pushed or pulled), no
TODO section is in progress (open, started and ready), and, when scheduled, no campaign run guard is held.

Eligible: an open pull request into main, opened by Dependabot or the pins workflow, labelled `dependencies` or `pins`,
mergeable, its head commit's checks all finished and green with every REQUIRED_CHECKS job succeeded, and its branch not on
EXCLUDED_BRANCHES (pins that are section work, merged by that section instead). Each is re-read right before it is
judged. The scheduled run holds the campaign guard's lock for its whole window.

Each merge: `gh pr merge <n> --rebase --match-head-commit <sha>` (linear history, and only the commit that was
checked), then `git pull --ff-only`, then `todo-graph.py validate`. The first failure stops the run, saying whether that
pull request is still open (the merge failed) or merged (the local follow-up failed); later ones wait for the operator.

Exit 0: merged, or nothing eligible, or not safe right now (said why). Exit 1: a merge or its follow-up failed.
