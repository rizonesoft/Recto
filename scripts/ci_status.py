"""Report the CI state of main: the latest completed run of each watched workflow, and runs still in progress.

    python scripts/ci_status.py                  # build.yml and plan.yml on main
    python scripts/ci_status.py --json           # the same report as one JSON object
    python scripts/ci_status.py --workflow build.yml --branch main

For each workflow (by default `build.yml` and `plan.yml`, the ones in `.github/workflows/` whose results gate main) it
reads the last 10 runs with `gh run list` and reports the latest completed run (green, red or cancelled), its verdict,
and how many newer runs are still queued or in progress. A cancelled run carries no verdict (a newer push usually
superseded it), so the verdict is the latest completed run that was not cancelled; with none in the last 10 runs the
verdict is `none`. For a red verdict it names the failed jobs from `gh run view <id> --json jobs`.

Exit 0: no watched workflow is red. Exit 1: at least one is red (the workflow, the commit, the run's URL and its
failed jobs are printed). Exit 2: bad usage. Exit 3: `gh` is missing, not authenticated, or failed, so the state is
unknown; that is never treated as green. The red-first policy that consumes this is in the `process-phase` skill.
Stdlib only; the `gh` runner is injectable for tests.
